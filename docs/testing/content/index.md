This page gives an overview of practical approaches and best practices for to keep your content as readable for as many users as possible.

## Reading level

People don’t read on the internet. They scan a page for keywords and only start reading when they  find what they are looking for. That’s why it’s important to make the text scannable and easy to read.

## Headings

Headings are the framework of your content. A good heading structure reflects the content on your page, like the index of a book:

- One H1 per page, describing what the page is about
- Use the other headings meaningful by their level and not by their font size
- A good heading describes in short the content that follows
- Do not skip a heading level

## Link texts

- Use meaningful link text that describes the content being linked to
- Avoid “click here”, “read more”, ”download”, ”continue reading” as link text. It’s meaningless and people have to read around the link to see what’s it about
- If you use an image as link, use the alternative text as link text

## Video and audio

- Make sure video has [closed captions](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/57243/whats-the-difference-between-closed-captions-and-subtitles-in-portal)
- Make sure audio has transcriptions
- Don’t autoplay video and audio

## Alternative text for images

Always give images proper alternative text using the W3C [alt decision tree](https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/57243/whats-the-difference-between-closed-captions-and-subtitles-in-portal).
