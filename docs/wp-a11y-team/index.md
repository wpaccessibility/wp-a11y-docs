# The WordPress Accessibility Team

WordPress is always changing and improving, it’s never truly finished. The same goes for making WordPress accessible to everyone. As the design, user experience, and code change, they need to be checked for accessibility.

The community also needs ongoing help and education to keep up with accessibility best practices. The Accessibility Team helps to improve the accessibility of WordPress core and resources.

Visit [Make WordPress Accessibility](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/) to read the blog about the current work of the team.

In the [WordPress Accessibility Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/) you can find more about the team itself and how to help or join in.
