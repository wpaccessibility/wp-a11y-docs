{: .tip }
**Rule of thumb**: Always tell a visitor what to expect when selecting a link.

## Open a link in a new window or tab?

Opening a link in a new window or tab unexpectedly can disorient users. It also breaks the “back button”. The best practice is to let the user decide if she wants to open a link in a new tab or window.

Not all screen readers alert users when a new window or tab has opened and for those with cognitive disabilities, they may have trouble interpreting what’s happened.

This can be prevented by not checking “open link in a new target” on links, so they don’t trigger new windows or tabs to open.

### But what if you insist?

If you absolutely need to open a link in a new window, you need to tell your visitor in the link text.

{: .example }
For example: I love cats, so I watch [cat videos (opens in a new tab)](#) on YouTube.

## Link to a document

If the link opens a document, add the format of the document in the link text.

{: .example }
You can [download the manual as PDF](#).
