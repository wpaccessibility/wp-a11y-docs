# Styling hover and focus

## Don’t remove native :focus styling

Most modern browsers have strong default `:focus` styling, making it easy for a user to tab from control to control and see clearly where they are on the page.

If you remove this, it is very easy for a sighted user to get lost and abandon the page. Custom `:focus` states are just fine; but avoid subtlety. Focus is an undirected action – meaning that the user does not know in advance where they are going, and will need to locate focus after it moves. Strong states make this easier.
