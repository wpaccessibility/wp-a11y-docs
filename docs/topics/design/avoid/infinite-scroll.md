We don’t recommend using infinite scroll because it has many significant accessibility issues:

- You can’t go back to your previous place using browser “back” button.
- You can’t easily get to the footer or the last items in the infinite scroll.
- There is a large memory footprint if loading big images.
- It doesn’t work without Javascript.
- You can’t access elements with keyboard only.
- There is no consistent audible feedback or instructions about how infinite scrolling works for assistive technologies.
- There is no URL to a specific place on the page.
- And the list goes on…

There is a great summary in the “[Reconsider the usage of infinite scrolling across the admin](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40330)” trac ticket for more information.

## Recommendations

Pagination with page numbers removes all the issues mentioned above.

![Pagination with page numbers from 1 to 9](../../../assets/pagination.png)

If the number of items to load is not too high, “Load more items” buttons could work as well. However, that option is limited to sequential usage and doesn’t provide any methods to access previously loaded items or the very last items to load.
