Related issue on [GitHub #164 Topic WordPress themes and accessibility](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/164).  

Creating a theme that supports accessibility is mostly about setting healthy defaults. This includes:

- ensuring the menus are accessible from the keyboard,
- checking that default color contrast meets standards,
- that the HTML structure uses semantically correct code.

The [standards for the WordPress theme directory’s accessibility-ready program](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility) are available in the Theme Review handbook, including testing instructions, so you can check your own theme.

**Note**: accessibility-ready does not mean a theme meets WCAG guidelines at level AA. It means that the theme reaches the minimum standards that the theme review team has set.

## WordPress.org Theme Directory

In the [Themes Directory](https://wordpress.org/themes/) on WordPress.org, select the ‘Accessibility Ready’ option in the Feature Filter to browse themes [tested against the “Accessibility Ready” guidelines](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/).

**Note**: Want to get your theme listed as “Accessibility Ready” on the Themes Repo? See the [themes review handbook for more information](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/).
