# Accessibility standards and best practice

What are the standards and best practices for an accessible website, theme or plugin?

In addition to the [Best Practices of WordPress Core](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/) (for development) and the [WordPress Style Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/design-guide/) (for design), this documentation will help you find information on how to make and keep your work accessible to as many people as possible.
