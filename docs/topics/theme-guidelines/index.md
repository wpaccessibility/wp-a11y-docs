# Theme accessibility guidelines

Theme developers may request an optional accessibility review as part of the theme review process or later for an existing theme.  Submitted themes (or theme updates) that pass a manual review are approved to use the `accessibility-ready` tag and show up in the theme directory as accessibility-ready.

This section outlines the requirements for the `accessibility-ready` tag with testing instructions for each requirement.

For additional information about the accessibility ready testing process, see:
