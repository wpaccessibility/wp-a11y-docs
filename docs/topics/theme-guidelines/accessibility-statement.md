# Accessibility Statement

## Basic Principle

Accessibility Ready themes must include an `accessibility.txt` file to help website owners make informed decisions when choosing a theme. 

This file has a standardized format outlining the theme's accessibility audit status, how it has been tested, and any included accessibility features. It also provides information on reporting accessibility issues, making it easier to ensure that websites remain compliant with accessibility standards over time.

## Testing

**Tools:** browser or text editor.

1. Verify that there is a file in the main theme directory named `accessibility.txt`.  
2. Open the `accessibility.txt` file with a text editor or the [theme file editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/wordpress/edit-files/).  
3. Review the contents of the file and verify it adheres to the WordPress [accessibility.txt readme standard.]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/documenting-accessibility/accessibility-txt/)
