# Accessibility statements

An accessibility statement is a public document on a website that explains the site’s current level of accessibility, the standards it aims to meet, and how users can report accessibility issues or request assistance.

Accessibility statements are not limited to describing website accessibility. Some WordPress plugin or theme developers may also include information about their plugins or themes in an accessibility statement on their website.

## What an accessibility statement includes

Typically, an accessibility statement includes:

* **A commitment statement**: a clear statement that the organization is working to make its website accessible or a philosophical statement about their approach to accessibility.
* **Standards or guidelines followed**: such as WCAG 2.1 or 2.2, and the targeted conformance level (e.g., AA).
* **Scope and status**: what parts of the site are covered and whether the site is fully, partially, or not yet compliant.
* **Known limitations**: any accessibility issues that are known and not yet fixed.
* **Feedback and contact information**: how users can report barriers or request alternative formats.
* **Enforcement or escalation information (in some regions)**: how users can file a complaint if issues are not addressed.

An accessibility statement is not an audit report or an [Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR).]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/documenting-accessibility/acr/) Instead, it’s a shorter document or more designed page that provides transparency, helps set expectations, and indicates a path for support. 

If you have an audit report or ACR for your product, that can be linked to from your accessibility statement page.

## Are accessibility statements required by law?

Whether an accessibility statement is legally required depends on geographic location, the website type, and who you serve. Most commonly accessibility statements are required for public sector or enterprise organizations in Europe. 

If you are not sure whether your website, plugin, or theme needs an accessibility statement, ask an attorney or legal expert in your area.

## How to create an accessibility statement

Many organizations use templates to generate their accessibility statement. Popular templates or accessibility statement generators include:

* [W3C accessibility statement generator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/generator/#create)
* [Gov.uk public sector accessibility statement template](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement) (UK-specific legal format)
* [European Commission model accessibility statement](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2018/1523/oj/eng) under the EU Web Accessibility Directive.
* [Equalize Digital Accessibility Checker WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessibility-checker) generates an accessibility statement draft page upon activation.

Because accessibility statements can have legal implications in certain parts of the world, it is recommended that you have a legal professional review your statement before publication.
