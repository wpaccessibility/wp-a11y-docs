# Indicate required fields in forms

Clearly indicate to the user whether a form field is required to fill out or not.
Then the user knows which information they must provide to submit a form. 

You have two options:

1. By visually marking non-required fields.
2. By visually marking required fields.

Both are fine, as long as you are consistent within the form and if possible also withing all forms on your website.

Always place the explanation of how you indicate this above the form, so the user knows beforehand what to expect when completing it.
