# Indicate required fields in forms

Clearly indicate to the user whether a form field is required.
Then the user can tell what information they must provide to submit a form. 

You have two options:ç√c

1. By visually marking required fields.
2. By visually marking optional fields.

Both are fine, as long as you are consistent within the form and, if possible, also within all forms on your website.

Always explain how you are indicating required fields above the form, so the user knows beforehand what to expect when completing it.
