# The best location for error messages

{: .callout .info }
Note: this is best practice and not a WCAG requirement.

For error messages, the same applies as for descriptions: the best location is above the form field. In addition, the error message must be linked to the form field via aria-describedby.

How to do this is described in the guideline [Place descriptions between label and form field]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/forms/descriptions/location-description/).
