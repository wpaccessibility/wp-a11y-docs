# The best location for error messages

For error messages, the same applies as for descriptions: the best location is above the form field. In addition, the error message must be linked to the form field via `aria-describedby`.

How to do this is described in the guideline [Place descriptions between label and form field]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/forms/descriptions/location-description/).

{: .callout .info }
Note: Placing the message above the form field is **best practice** and not a WCAG requirement.
