# Feedback on form errors

Use understandable, well-timed error messages and logical validation rules. If a form field is not filled in correctly, it should be clear to everyone what is wrong. 

Please also read our blog post [Accessible error messages in forms](/blog/2025/accessible-error-messages-forms/), which explains step by step how to prevent errors, indicate them, and provide help with error messages in a form for different types of users. Another good writeup is [A Guide To Accessible Form Validation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/02/guide-accessible-form-validation/) by Sandrina Pereira on Smashing Magazine.

Making error messages accessible is necessary to comply with [WCAG Success Criterion 3.3.1 Error Identification](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#error-identification) (Level A).
