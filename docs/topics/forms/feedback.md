## Provide accessible notifications

When a dynamic event occurs, it should be announced audibly by screen readers. A dynamic event is any event that is reacting to a user without a page refresh: either a direct scripted validation or an AJAX request.

A good way to announce dynamic notifications in WordPress is using [wp.a11y-speak()](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/best-practices/markup/wp-a11y-speak/). This JavaScript function is included in WordPress core and enables you to announce dynamic changes and notifications to screen reader users.
