# Allow copying and pasting of data in a form field

Personal data needs to be secure. This includes any personal or private information, including bank account numbers, national identification numbers, or any complex data where accuracy is paramount.

If you prevent copying and pasting of, for example, a password, you force users to choose simple, easy-to-remember passwords. That is exactly what you want to avoid.

Copying and pasting from a password manager is a much easier and safer way for users to enter data. As explained by the UK National Cyber Security Centre in [Top tips for staying secure online](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online).
