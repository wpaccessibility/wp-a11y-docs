# Allow copying and pasting of passwords

A password needs to be secure. If you prevent copying and pasting of passwords, you force users to choose simple, easy-to-remember passwords. That is exactly what you want to avoid.

Copying and pasting from a password manager is a much easier and safer way for users to enter a password. As explained by the UK National Cyber Security Centre in [Top tips for staying secure online](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/top-tips-for-staying-secure-online).
