## Educational & Discussion

Sometimes, what you’re building doesn’t have an already-available accessible pattern on the web. In cases like these, it can be helpful to consult someone who works day-to-day in the accessibility field in order to save yourself the pain of having to figure it out all on your own. There are a few resources you may find helpful.

### The WebAIM mailing list

The [WebAIM mailing list](https://webaim.org/discussion/) is a long-running community forum for everyone who wants to grow in their accessibility journey, from beginner to expert. The archives span decades, and are available to search through. if you need to find the solution to a problem, or need help creating one, and you don’t know what question to ask when searching the archives, list members are very friendly and always willing to help, without judgment.
