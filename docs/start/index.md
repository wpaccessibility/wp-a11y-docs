# Start with accessibility

## What is web accessibility?

<blockquote>
    <p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent access to websites by people with disabilities.</p>

The Web is for everyone, not just those who see, hear and move well. Building your website for inclusion, rather than exclusion, increases access for people of all abilities; as well as for all types of browsers and search engines.

## What does a11y mean?

Accessibility is often abbreviated as a11y; “a” is the first character of the word, and “y” the last , with 11 characters in between. (similar to i18n for “internationalization”). So when you tweet about accessibility, use the hashtags #a11y or #wpa11y.

## Include everyone

By adopting the accessibility best practices you can ensure your website can be used by a large group of different people. Don't create for perfect people only. More about this in [They're not my visitors]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/start/myths/personas/).

## Consider your business

The website you build is not for you, or even your client. It’s for the users. Increasing accessibility instantly gains you a larger potential user-base. Read about the business case in [Accessibility for your business]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/start/business/).

## Consider your development process

For developers web accessibility means a way of thinking often called progressive enhancement:

- Let the HTML tell the content.
- Let the CSS present the content.
- Let the JavaScript interact with the content.

This division helps you create websites that are easier to maintain and update, and is considered to be a (c)lean approach to web development.
[Standards and best practice]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/) explains how to code with sematics and accessibility in mind.

## In Summary

A11y includes everyone when building websites. Think of it as your ally in optimizing your website’s user-experience, for as many people as possible, while furthering your business or organizational goals.
