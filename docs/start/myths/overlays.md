# Overlays

## What are Accessibility Overlays?

Accessibility overlays are third-party plugins or scripts added to a website to improve accessibility.  
They are often promoted as a quick way to meet legal requirements.  

Most overlays work by adding JavaScript to a page.  
They usually appear as a small icon on the screen.  
When opened, the icon shows options like text resizing, color contrast changes, or other display settings.  

## The Difference Between Overlays and Toolbars

Overlays and toolbars may look similar, but they work in different ways.  

**Overlays** try to fix accessibility issues automatically as a site loads.  
They cannot repair problems in the original HTML, ARIA, or CSS.  
In many cases, overlays add new barriers and give a false sense of compliance.  

**Toolbars** do not change the website itself.  
They allow people to adjust their own experience, such as changing font size or contrast.  
Toolbars are most useful on sites that are already accessible, because they build on good practice rather than replacing it.
