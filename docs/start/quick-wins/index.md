What to do first? Start with the low-hanging fruit. Color contrast of text ia an easy fix. Alternative text with images probably too.

The most made errors reported in the yearly report [WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) are:

- Low color contrast for texttext
- Missing Alternative Text on images
- Missing labels in forms
- Empty links
- Empty buttons
- Missing language in the `<html>` element

96% of all errors detected fall into these six categories. 

So: if these errors are all sorted, you are already better than 96% of the web.
