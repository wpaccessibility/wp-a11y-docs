# Quick wins

What to do first? Start with the low-hanging fruit. Color contrast of text ia an easy fix. Alternative text with images probably too.

The most made errors reported in the yearly report [WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) are:

- Low [color contrast for text]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/design/color/color-contrast-text/)
- [Missing alternative]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/content/alt-text/) text on images
- Missing [labels in forms]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/forms/input-label/accessible-name/)
- Empty [links]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/content/links/link-text/)
- Empty [buttons]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/topics/code/accessible-name/)
- Missing [language in the `<html>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/lang)

96% of all errors detected fall into these six categories. 

So: if these errors are all sorted, you are already better than 96% of the web.
