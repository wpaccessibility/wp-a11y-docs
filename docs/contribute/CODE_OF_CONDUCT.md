# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

The WordPress Accessibility Team believes our community should be truly open for everyone. As such, we are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting.

## Consequences of unacceptable behavior

The WordPress Accessibility Team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## What to do if you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the [project lead](https://rianrietveld.com/contact-rian-rietveld/). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project lead is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
