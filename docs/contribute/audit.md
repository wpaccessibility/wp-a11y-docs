# Audit the accessibility of this website

A website about accessibility (a11y) must be accessible itself. That's a no-brainer. We want to meet WCAG 2.2 AA and do our very best to comply to that. We'd love to have an independent [WCAG-EM audit](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/), that results in a [WCAG-EM report](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/). Your name or your company name will be added to the [contributors list](/docs/contributors/).

We then will add that information in our [accessibility statement](/docs/about/accessibility-statement/) and fix the issues found. See the GitHub issue: [Audit the website for accessibility WCAG 2.2 AA](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues/4).

Did you notice an a11y-issue on this website? Please inform us by opening an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/issues).

Please note: this is only for accessibility issues in **this website** and not for WordPress itself. If you find an accessibility issue in WordPress core, or in one of the core themes, please create a [new ticket on Make WordPress Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket) and give it the focus “accessibility”.

### Contribute with regular accessibility audits

We would value a full [WCAG-EM audit](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/conformance/wcag-em/) and [WCAG-EM report](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/) for WCAG 2.2 AA to start and a yearly update for the new content and functionality.

Your name or your company name will be added to the sponsor list. [Contact Rian Rietveld](https://rianrietveld.com/contact-rian-rietveld/) if you want to sponsor this project with regular WCAG-EM audits of wpaccessibility.org.
