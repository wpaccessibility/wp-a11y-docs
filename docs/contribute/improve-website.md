WPaccessibility.org is written in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator in Ruby using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for content. The theme is based on the Jekyll theme [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/). For the changes made in Just the Docs, please read the [Changelog for Release v0.1](/CHANGELOG/#release-v01).
