Please note: this is only for errors in the documentation or code in **wpaccessibility.org** and not for WordPress itself. If you find an accessibility issue in WordPress core, or in one of the core themes, please create a [new ticket on Make WordPress Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket) and give it the focus “accessibility”.
