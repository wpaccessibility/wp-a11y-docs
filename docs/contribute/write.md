# Write documentation

Before you start writing new documentation, please inform us you want to work this, we will assign the work to you. We keep track of the work on the documentation in the project board [WP A11y docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3).

To keep all pages in the same structure, please stick to the following formats.

{: .tip }
Please write the content yourself and use AI only to translate or to check the quality of your English.

## Content structure of a blogpost

- Title (65 charters or less)
- A short summary in one or two paragraphs
- The main content of the blogpost

## Content structure of an accessibility topic

One page per topic. This makes it easier to read and also to refer to in other documentation.

- Title (65 charters or less)
- A short summary in one or two paragraphs
- Main content describing what, why, who benefits and the how to do in WordPress (if applicable)
- Additional content, depending on the topic, like for example:
