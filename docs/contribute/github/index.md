# Technical documentation wpaccessibility.org

We use the GitHub repository [wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/wp-a11y-docs/) for the documentation on wpaccessibility.org.

The project board [WP A11y docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3) contains all open issues and also the pull requests to review.

{: .alert }
Before you start writing new documentation, please let us know that you’d like to work on it, so we can assign the task to you. Content written without contacting the project leads first, will not be reviewed.
