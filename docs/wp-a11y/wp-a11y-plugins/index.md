# WordPress accessibility plugins

There are many plugins available for WordPress that can help support accessibility. These tools work in many ways. Some are website features built in a way that's specifically designed for accessibility, others help you create accessible content, and others help ensure that other plugins are more accessible.

## Criteria for inclusion on this page:
The plugin:

- has a free level of service that does not require registration and provides enough functionality to be testable by the WordPress Accessibility Team
- is not primarily dedicated to accessibility testing. Testing plugins are listed in [WordPress plugins for accessibility testing]().
- doesn't provide [overlay functionality](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/) that cannot be fully disabled.
- has an accessible admin interface
- has been updated within the last year

**Alert:** Note that while many plugins in the WordPress plugin repository are overlays or widgets, none of those are listed here. The WordPress Accessibility team does not recommend the usage of [accessibility overlays](https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/).

## Accessible Features

Plugins that add a commonly used feature, but with a specific focus on accessibility.

- [Able Player for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ableplayer/). Able Player is a media player that offers extensive support for accessible features such as Audio Description, speed adjustment, and interactive transcriptions.
- [My Calendar - Accessible Event Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/my-calendar/). My Calendar is a full-featured event management plugin that includes support for event and location accessibility features and has a robustly accessible interface.

## Plugin or Theme Specific Patterns

Plugins that improve the accessibility of a specific theme or plugin.

## General Purpose

Multi-purpose accessibility plugins that are not easily placed in another category, and are not primarily focused on testing.

- [WP Accessibility](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-accessibility/). Helps with a variety of common accessibility problems in WordPress themes. While most accessibility issues can’t be addressed without directly changing your theme, WP Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with a minimum amount of setup or expert knowledge.
