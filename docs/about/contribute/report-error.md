Did you find an error in this documentation or a bug in the website wpaccessibility.org? Please let us know. 

There are several ways you can report an error:
- Fill out [our contact form](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/accessibility-knowledge-base-contact/) on WordPress.org, and describe the error.
- Share your findings in the Make WordPress [#accessibility-docs Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C6PK2QCTY).

**Please note:** This is only for errors in the documentation or code in **wpaccessibility.org** and not for WordPress itself. If you find an accessibility issue in WordPress core, or in one of the core themes, please create a [new ticket on Make WordPress Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket) and give it the focus “accessibility”.
