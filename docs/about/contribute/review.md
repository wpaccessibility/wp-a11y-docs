# Review documentation

## New documentation
You can find documentation to review in the project board [WP A11y Docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3) in the column **PRs to review**.

With each pull request (PR) you can find a link to a preview of the proposed new documentation.
Review only the content that is new and related to the topic of the pull request.

There are several ways you can give feedback:
- Fill out [our contact form](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/accessibility-knowledge-base-contact/) on WordPress.org, and describe the error.
- Share your findings in the Make WordPress [#accessibility-docs Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C6PK2QCTY).
- Comment with the pull request you are reviewing.

## The existing documentation

When you read through the existing documentation and find content you think is not right, please [report this]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/about/contribute/report-error/) as an error.
