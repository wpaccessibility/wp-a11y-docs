# Write documentation

{: .callout  .alert }
**Alert:** Before you start writing new documentation, please let us know that you’d like to work on it, so we can assign the task to you. Content written without contacting the project leads first, will not be reviewed.

We keep track of the work on the documentation in the project board [WP A11y docs](https://github.com/orgs/wpaccessibility/projects/3).

{: .callout  .tip }
**Tip:** Please write the content yourself and use AI (artificial intelligence) only to translate or to check the quality of your English.

To keep all pages in the same structure, please stick to the following formats for a blogpost or an accessibility topic.

## Content structure of a blogpost

- Title (65 charters or less)
- A short summary in one or two paragraphs
- The main content of the blogpost

## Content structure of an accessibility topic

One page per topic. This makes it easier to read and also to refer to in other documentation.

- Title, if possible 65 characters or fewer, including spaces
- A short summary in one or two paragraphs
- Main content describing what, why, who benefits and how to do this in WordPress (if applicable)
- Additional content, depending on the topic, like for example:
  - User experience with demos
  - Quick wins and workarounds
  - Code examples
  - Supporting images
  - Video/Audio with demos
  - Dos/don’ts
  - Frequently made mistakes and how to fix them
  - How to test or refer to checklist
- Resources
  - Related WCAG Success Criteria
  - Related info in this documentation
  - Other relevant resources
