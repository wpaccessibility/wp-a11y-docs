    "content": "Theme of this website is based on the Just The Docs Jekyll theme. Just the Docs is distributed by an MIT license. Copyright (c) 2016 Patrick Marsceill. In this initial release the theme is renamed into WP A11y Docs. The URL for the GitHib pages is wpaccessibility.org. File organisation . This will be a one design theme only, so all the changes will be done directly in the files itself. This simplifies the code and makes the theme better maintainable. For this the following changes were made: . | Removed custom files and their references. | Removed redundant include files. | Removed the nav-footer: took up too much space and added a second &lt;footer&gt;. | Added option for posts and post pagination. | Refactored the breadcrumbs for the posts. | Removed Just the Docs info pages and create placeholder text to match the actual site structure. | Set Ruby to 3.3.6. | Added option to add a canonical URL. | . SCSS . | Refactoring directory structure. | Removed the dark theme for now, that will be restored when the theme is finished and stable. | Replaced @import for @use, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced darken by color.scale and color.adjust, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced deprecated global built-in functions by Sass values (sass:map, sass:color, sass:list etc.). | . CSS color contrast issue . | Placeholder: fixt color contrast and opacity. | Fixed color contrast issues for text and non-text meaningful elements. | . Search at the top of the page . | Refactored the HTML of the form to make the HTML valid. | Added screen reader feedback to announce number of search results. | . _config.yml . | Removed Google Analytics Tracking settings. | Removed most variable because this is a static site. | Changed names and colours of the callouts to match those used in WordPress documentation style guide | . Accessibility improvements . | Moved the button to expand the submenus to after the submenu link, so the tab order is meaningful. | Changed aria-pressed by aria-expanded, see also issue Change aria-pressed into aria-expanded for buttons connected to expandable content. | Added aria-current=\"page\" to links to the current page. | Removed anchor links before headings. The link was inside the heading, resulting in announcing the heading text twice. Maybe we find an accessible way later on. | Copy code button is now always visible (not only on hover) and has a larger clickable area. The copy action has now also screenreader feedback. | The code blocks now have a tabindex=”0”. | . ",

Visual text or equivalent, like a search icon, should always be visible, so sighted users don’t have to guess what they need to fill out. If you must hide a label or control from vision, use the CSS class .screen-reader-text or equivalent.

Color contrast is an important issue to address for the accessibility of your website. It should be considered for foreground (text and other elements) and background colors (or images), but also between elements and hover or focus states. Color contrast should be high enough for good readability, but should not be too bright for people with sensitive eyes or cognitive problems.There are no WCAG criteria defining excessively high contrast, but very high contrast should be used selectively. The WordPress project follows the accessibility level “AA” of WCAG. This requires that the contrast between background and foreground colors has a luminosity contrast ratio of: . | 4.5:1 for normal text | 3:1 for large text (24px equivalent or 19px equivalent and bold) | . There are many tools to check color contrast ratios. WebAxe published an overview of contrast checkers.

Never blame the user for not getting it. Most people struggle with the amount of information and functionality on the web. Help users as much as possible to successfully submit the form. Therefore, make error messages as descriptive and tailored as possible. Instead of “Invalid input” or “This field is required,” for example, write: . For example: . | Enter a valid email address, for example name@example.com. | The expiration date of your passport must be in the future. | Please enter you email address, so we can send you the confirmation of your appointment. | . Tip: Use a period . at the end of the error message (or any other message). This causes the screen reader to pause briefly and makes it clearer that the error message is a separate sentence.

A screen reader user can call a list of links to quickly navigate a site. Then duplicate and meaningless links are annoying and time-consuming. Duplicate links . How many links per block will go to the same location? Is the post title, the thumbnail and the read more all linked to the same destination? That will cause a great deal of link clutter on your page. If you have, for example, 3 links to the same destination, consider removing 2 from the link list by adding the attribute aria-hidden=\"true\". Then the link is removed from the screen readers link list. But adding aria-hidden=\"true\" alone might be confusing because you can tab into it, but it doesn’t announce anything for the screen reader users. So: take the link also out of the tab order by using tabindex=\"-1\": . &lt;a href=\"your-url\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"&gt; link text &lt;/a&gt; . Meaningless link text . Link text like “Read more…” or “Continue reading…” are meaningless, especially in a link list for screen reader users. Read more about what? It’s best to give context to links. Include the post title for your “read more” links so screen readers understand what’s being linked to, and optionally hide this by using the CSS class .screen-reader-text. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt; Your post title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Notice the blank space inside the .screen-reader-text? This separates teh words so the text is read out as “continue reading your” instead of “continue readingyour”. The alt text of the thumbnail . If the thumbnail is placed inside a link, the alt attribute serves as the link text. So it’s important that the alt text is not empty and contains the post title of the post it’s linking to. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Block level links . Wrapping a block level element, for example a heading and an image, inside a link is not helpful for screen readers. The whole content is read and there is no indication if an element inside the block is a heading or an image. Therefore, do not wrap the block level element in a link but place the link inside the child elements of the block. For example: . &lt;div class=\"your-card\"&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Your post title&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . ",

Removing the “continue reading” link could be an option to cleanup the link clutter. The “continue reading” link is hidden for screen readers, but it has screen reader text. This is useful because, if a user has her own stylesheet, or watches the sites without stylesheet, the link text is still understandable.

Use heading 2, 3 and 4 to divide your content into meaningful sections, like the index of a book. Choose heading levels by meaning, not by visible size. This way search engines and screen readers (software used by your blind visitors) understand the structure and meaning of the content better. Headings are the index of your content. Content with a good heading structure ranks better with the search engines. Use it to divide content into scannable blocks; both Google and your visitor will like it. If you don’t like the sizes of the headings in your content, you should adjust the design of the heading rather than selecting a different heading.

Strong semantic structure, like what is provided by fieldset and legend is very helpful in understanding complex forms. However, providing assistance to users can sometimes make the difference between having a user complete a process and abandon it. Instructions can range anywhere from an aria-describedby description associated with a single input, to a modal dialog that gives additional context or provides a worksheet to help the user calculate a value. Importantly, the line between understandable and…not can be very blurry; and you should always be looking at your form with an empathetic eye. Your knowledge of the form is likely much greater than your user’s. Validate user input . If it is possible to know whether a value is acceptable before the form is submitted, you should provide accessible validation as soon as possible. That validation should do more than simply notifying the user there is a problem with the field; it should also tell them how to fix it, if you’re able to provide that information. For example, in a required email field, you should be able to quickly identify the difference between a missing email and an invalid format, and provide feedback accordingly.

You may think that you’re not including any images in your project. Possibly this is true; but are you using dashicons or other icon fonts? Are you using SVG graphics? . For accessibility, “images” doesn’t only refer to the img element. It means any non-text graphical elements on the page. This is particularly crucial if you’re using images to represent controls – a hamburger menu icon, an arrow, or a plus or minus icon. These images are used to represent information. All of these images require accessibility considerations. The W3C offers a useful decision tree to help you decide what kind of text you need for an image. If your image is conveying information or activating a control, it’s going to need some form of accessible name. Making an image accessible doesn’t necessarily mean ensuring that it is named, however. If an image is the sole presentation of data, then it needs to be named.

    "content": "Forms, buttons, toggles, tabs – these are all elements commonly used both in the admin of your plugin and in public-facing interfaces. They’re also some of the most critical pieces for achieving a basic level of accessibility. At minimum, you should be considering: . Fields should be labeled . Every form input needs to have an associated &lt;label&gt; element. Those labels should be an accurate representation of the information required for that form. The label should be associated with the field using a for/id relationship: . &lt;label for=\"my_field\"&gt;Share your story&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=\"my_field\" name=\"my_story\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; . Avoid hiding your labels visually. If you do need to hide a label, use a standard .screen-reader-text class to do so. Learn more about visually hidden text. Form groups need group names . If you’re providing a group of checkboxes or radio buttons, the label for the input isn’t usually enough information: it tells you the value you’re selecting, but not the question you’re trying to answer. Checkboxes and radio buttons should be grouped inside a &lt;fieldset&gt; with a &lt;legend&gt;. &lt;fieldset&gt; &lt;legend&gt;Why do you love WordPress plugins?&lt;/legend&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio1\" value=\"money\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio1\"&gt;Money&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio2\" value=\"fame\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio2\"&gt;Fame&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio3\" value=\"respect\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio3\"&gt;Respect&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/fieldset&gt; . Buttons should be &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; elements . Attaching JavaScript to &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; elements can work great for mouse users, but leaves a ton of gaps for anybody using a screen reader or keyboard to use your site. Using standard form elements helps ensure that forms and toggles work for everybody. You can use an anchor element for button-like behavior, but this creates accessibility problems, such as preventing the user from cancelling the action. Announce dynamic changes audibly . When an AJAX action runs, announce it audibly or move focus to an appropriate new location on the page. WordPress contains a useful method called wp.a11y.speak() that you can use to announce results audibly. This gives screen reader users important feedback that something is happening, and what they can do next. If you’d show a result visually, you should also announce it audibly. Learn more about wp.a11y.speak(). Moving focus to a new location on the page will also generate new information for screen readers. This is appropriate when the action taken changes the user’s view, and they need to be informed of the change. Make it easy to identify and correct errors . When users input data into a form, provide them with feedback when a submission is made and notify them when they have entered something incorrectly. The error message should clearly describe the error and provide them with suggestions for correcting the error. Errors must be indicated by more than just a change of color. You can use icons and error lists to present this visually but make sure you audibly announce it. Use Color Appropriately . Good color contrast is important to make sure that users with a variety of visual impairments can use your interface. The most common problem cited is color blindness, but presbyopia (age-related vision impairments) are even more common, and most specifically impacted by low contrast. As eyes age, their ability to perceive low contrast differences decreases. The WCAG 2.1 guidelines measure contrast using a ratio comparing the relative luminosity of the colors. The guidelines stipulate a minimum contrast of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3.0:1 for large text using this ratio. You can test your colors using many tools: . | Joe Dolson’s Color Contrast Tool | WebAIM’s ContrastChecker | Lea Verou’s Contrast Ratio | . Good color contrast doesn’t mean extremely high contrast; the guidelines set a minimum baseline, and any contrast that meets that baseline is acceptable. ",

An image can be an &lt;img&gt; element, an icon font, or an svg element; but any graphical representation is considered an image for these purposes. Different types of graphics use different types of accessible names. For &lt;img&gt; elements, the accessible name should be in the alt attribute. If the img is ornamental, the alt attribute should still be included, but left empty. For icon fonts, the icon itself should have the aria-hidden attribute, with screen-reader-text in a neighbor element. If the icon is ornamental, the font icon should still have the aria-hidden attribute, but the screen reader text should be omitted. &lt;a href=\"this.html\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"dashicons dashicon-thumbs-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;Something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . For SVG, the SVG should be inline, so that accessible information isn’t hidden from assistive technology. SVG elements should contain a &lt;title&gt; element with the accessible name of the image. For cross-technology support, the title element should be associated with the svg element via aria-labelledby. For maximum compatibility, all SVG elements used to represent an image should carry the role attribute with a value of img. If the SVG element is ornamental, then the title element should be omitted and no aria-labelledby attribute should be present. The SVG element should also carry the aria-hidden attribute. | More information on SVG Accessibility by Léonie Watson | . Labeling . Existing code uses a mixture of explicitly and implicitly labeled fields, but all new code must use an explicitly associated element (using for/id attributes and not wrapping the form control). Labels are not required to be visible, but must use the .screen-reader-text class when hidden. Placeholders are fine, but are not a substitute for labels. For all labels, clicking on the field label should cause the associated field to receive focus or, for checkboxes and radio selectors, select that choice. Don’t introduce new title attributes to convey information. Use aria-label when you need to provide an alternate label and .screen-reader-text if you’re appending additional data. When using aria-label, be sure that the aria-label value contains any visible text on the control. The visible text should be the first part of the aria-label text. E.g. &lt;button type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Delete this post\"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt; . When creating forms, use &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; to group logically related form elements inside complex forms or to group radio buttons and checkboxes under a heading. ",

    "content": "The big difference between PHP and JavaScript code standard checks and accessibility checks is that the accessibility checks need to be performed on the generated DOM, not on the code base. You need to run checks on a working WordPress site. This can be done using automation that sets up your environment dynamically, but still requires a fully built and run installation. There are several command line tools for automated testing like aXe-cli and pa11y. Info: Automated accessibility testing doesn’t catch all the issues, rarely more than 30%. Testing in the browser and manual keyboard testing still needs to be part of your workflow. Setup for aXe-cli . Install axe-core for CLI first: . npm install axe-cli -g npm install chromedriver –g` . Then run axe in the command line: . axe url -b c . The url can be any url, also a local one. You get a report of the accessibility issues for that url. The -b stands for browser, c for chrome, as this browser gives the best results (better than the default PhantomJS). You will get the errors and warnings in your console. You can provide more (space separated) urls to the command like . axe url url2 url3 -b c . or call a file with urls like: . axe $( cat list-of-urls.txt ) -b c . Note: You can run axe-cli on more than one url in one command, but axe-cli is not build to run on a large amount of urls or on a complete site, axe-cli is not a crawler. Deque Labs recommends to use the axe-webdriverjs, a chainable aXe API for Selenium’s WebDriverJS for testing on a large amounts of urls. Setup for pa11y .

Rule of thumb: a link text should describe the resource that it links to, so that when the text is read out of context the user will still know what to expect. A link is a promise, not a surprise. Link text should stand on its own. Some assistive software scans a page for links and presents them to the user as a simple list. In these situations, all the links will be read out of context. So it is important the text used in a link is descriptive and meaningful. It also makes your text easier to scan visually, so that sighted users can more quickly find the information they’re looking for. Descriptive, meaningful link text in the Apple VoiceOver link list. Make links texts descriptive . Avoid meaningless link text like: click here, download, info, more, here, this. With these types of links, users have to read the whole sentence to understand the purpose of the link. This makes your content less browsable, and harder to engage with. Screen reader users cannot navigate by links, because those links are not useful without additional context. Useless, non-descriptive link text in the Apple VoiceOver link list.

Emoji are independently accessible; they do have text alternatives. However, a large number of emoji can make the text effectively impossible to comprehend. Avoid writing links in all caps . Sequences of all capital letters are harder to read for people with dyslexia, screen readers may interpret short capitalized words as abbreviations, and read the words out character by character. This is also true if text is capitalized using CSS. Avoid using complete URLs as link text . Some URLs are highly readable, such as “wordpress.org”. Others are almost impossible to parse as language. In most cases, you should avoid using a URL as the visible link text. If you are explicitly referring to a web address, keep it short: wordpress.org instead of https://www.wordpress.org.
