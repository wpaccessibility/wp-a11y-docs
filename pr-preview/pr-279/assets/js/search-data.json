This section provides a short summary of your approach to accessibility during theme development, goals, or accessibility commitments. Examples: . “This theme was designed and developed with accessibility best practices in mind, following WCAG 2.2 guidelines.” . “We are committed to making our plugins usable by as many people as possible, including those using assistive technologies.” . Quick Information . The Quick Information section provides a high-level overview of the theme’s or plugin’s accessibility test status and conformance level. Some content in this section is optional or may be omitted if it does not apply. | Accessibility audit completed: Yes or No. Answer yes if the theme or plugin has been audited for accessibility conformance with an officially recognized standard such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), EN 301 549, etc. The testing may have been completed by you or an external organization or individual. | Most recent audit date: (OPTIONAL) provide the date when most recent audit was completed. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Tested to standard and conformance level: (OPTIONAL) if an audit has been completed, list the standard it was tested against here and whether it supports, partially supports, or does not support the standard. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Audited by: (OPTIONAL) Provide a comma-separated list of wordpress.org userid’s or markdown-formatted links with Company Names and URLs for the people or organization that performed the most recent audit. This can help to provide trustworthiness or third-party verification to the audit. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Accessibility Conformance Report: (OPTIONAL) URL to an Accessibility Conformance Report for the theme or plugin. Omit if an ACR is not available. Learn more about ACRs | . Testing Tools and Methodology . This section details how accessibility was tested and integrated into your development workflow. Be as detailed as possible to help website owners understand how the theme was tested as it was built, and if there is ongoing testing for updates. List tools and techniques used, and if the theme was tested by a third-party accessibility specialist. If users with disabilities or everyday users of assistive technology have participated in the testing process also include that information. Example: . “Accessibility was a core part of the development workflow for this theme from the initial design phase through final release. We followed WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines to ensure the theme is usable by people with a wide range of abilities and assistive technologies. During development, we used a combination of automated and manual testing methods: . | Automated Tools: . | Accessibility Checker WordPress plugin | axe DevTools browser extension | WAVE browser extension | ESLint with accessibility-focused rules for JSX and ARIA usage | . | Manual Testing Techniques: . | Keyboard-only navigation testing to ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable | Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS) to verify meaningful announcements, focus order, and labeling | Manual color contrast checks using the WebAIM Contrast Checker | Testing responsive behaviors to ensure accessibility is preserved on mobile and tablet devices | . All components and templates were tested for accessibility as they were developed. Additionally, we performed a full accessibility audit prior to release. The audit was conducted internally and verified by an external accessibility expert, John Doe, and we conducted user testing sessions with three blind screen reader users. We maintain a version-controlled accessibility checklist, and all theme updates go through regression testing to ensure accessibility is preserved. Any reported issues from users are logged and reviewed as part of our regular release process. This proactive and ongoing approach helps ensure the theme remains compliant and usable for all site visitors.” . | . Screen Reader Text Class . This section names the CSS class used in your theme or plugin to visually hide content but make it available to screen readers. Including the class here makes it easier for website owners to find and use the class. You may use any naming convention for your class, but must visually hide content with the required CSS for a screen reader text class. Example: .screen-reader-text . Accessibility Features . A list or description of accessibility enhancements built into the theme or plugin above and beyond theme accessibility-ready requirements. This section can be omitted if no features exist. Example: . “In addition to meeting accessibility-ready requirements, the theme provides stylesheets for light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode. These styles will be enabled automatically based on operating system color mode preferences, but in the theme settings, there is an option to turn on a front-end toggle allowing users to switch between color modes.” . Accessibility Help Contact . This section tells users how to get help if they experience accessibility issues with your theme or plugin. Examples: . “If you need accessibility help, email us at support@example.com.” . “Accessibility support information: https://example.com/support” . Where to Report Issues . This section provides a designated channel for users to report accessibility bugs or concerns. Examples: . https://wordpress.org/support/theme/theme-slug-here/ . “Please report accessibility issues on our GitHub repository, https://github.com/URL.” . ",

US postal codes can either be five digits or five digits, a hyphen, and four digits, e.g. ‘12345-2345’ or ‘12345’. UK Postal codes vary in length between 5 and 7 characters in two parts, with both parts able to contain a mix of letters and numbers. Extra spaces at the beginning or end can also be included when text is copied and pasted. In code, these variations can easily be normalized to a single format. By accepting all valid ways and letting the software correct them, you prioritize the user instead of your software. ",

Look for: . | Links | Buttons | Any other advanced controls, such as accordions or tabs. | . | Right-click on each control and select Inspect to open the browser dev tools inspector. | Verify the control has a unique accessible name that clearly describes its purpose.

    "content": "There are a few things to watch out for to make this usable for everyone. | avoid multiple / duplicate links to the same location (see examples below) | avoid meaningless link texts (see examples below) | make sure that the thumbnail has an appropriate link text | avoid block level links | . A screen reader user can call a list of links to quickly navigate a site. Then duplicate and meaningless links are annoying and time-consuming. Duplicate links . How many links per block will go to the same location? Is the post title, the thumbnail and the read more all linked to the same destination? That will cause a great deal of link clutter on your page. If you have, for example, 3 links to the same destination, consider removing 2 from the link list by adding the attribute aria-hidden=\"true\". Then the link is removed from the screen readers link list. But adding aria-hidden=\"true\" alone might be confusing because you can tab into it, but it doesn’t announce anything for the screen reader users. So: take the link also out of the tab order by using tabindex=\"-1\": . &lt;a href=\"your-url\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"&gt; link text &lt;/a&gt; . Meaningless link text . Link text like “Read more…” or “Continue reading…” are meaningless, especially in a link list for screen reader users. Read more about what? It’s best to give context to links. Include the post title for your “read more” links so screen readers understand what’s being linked to, and optionally hide this by using the CSS class .screen-reader-text. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt; Your post title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Notice the blank space inside the .screen-reader-text? This separates teh words so the text is read out as “continue reading your” instead of “continue readingyour”. The alt text of the thumbnail . If the thumbnail is placed inside a link, the alt attribute serves as the link text. So it’s important that the alt text is not empty and contains the post title of the post it’s linking to. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Block level links . Wrapping a block level element, for example a heading and an image, inside a link is not helpful for screen readers. The whole content is read and there is no indication if an element inside the block is a heading or an image. Therefore, do not wrap the block level element in a link but place the link inside the child elements of the block. For example: . &lt;div class=\"your-card\"&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Your post title&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . ",

But the link will show up in the headings list too this way, so that’s probably not a bad thing. As we are all used to the heading being a link, it has become a WordPress convention. Removing the “continue reading” link could be an option to clean up the link clutter. The “continue reading” link is hidden for screen readers, but it has screen reader text. This is useful because, if a user has her own stylesheet, or watches the sites without stylesheet, the link text is still understandable. Also adding the screen-reader-text class improves the quality of the link text, important for SEO (search engine optimization). ",

There is also no explanation when specific patterns are not met, as Adrian Roselli points out in Avoid default field validation. It is preferable to add custom client-side validation. If you decide to use required, also use novalidate on the form element to prevent the browser’s form validation from kicking in and enable you to handle validation server-side.

This is particularly crucial if you’re using images to represent controls – a hamburger menu icon, an arrow, or a plus or minus icon. These images are used to represent information.

The advantage to this is that the form fields are grouped together both visually and semantically, making the design match the code. The fieldset and legend elements are the native HTML way to group fields. When a screen reader enters a fieldset, the legend of that group will be announced. This is a helpful way of grouping related fields together, such as differentiating between an order address and a shipping address; but is critical when grouping radio buttons and checkboxes. &lt;fieldset&gt; &lt;legend&gt;Which is the best color?&lt;/legend&gt; &lt;input name=\"colorOption\" type=\"radio\" id=\"purple\" value=\"purple\" /&gt; &lt;label for=\"purple\"&gt;Purple&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input name=\"colorOption\" type=\"radio\" id=\"aubergine\" value=\"aubergine\" /&gt; &lt;label for=\"aubergine\"&gt;Aubergine&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input name=\"colorOption\" type=\"radio\" id=\"magenta\" value=\"magenta\" /&gt; &lt;label for=\"magenta\"&gt;Magenta&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input name=\"colorOption\" type=\"radio\" id=\"all\" value=\"all\" /&gt; &lt;label for=\"all\"&gt;All of the above&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/fieldset&gt; .

The same can be achieved by using role=\"group\" and aria-labelledby. But always keep the first rule of ARIA use in mind: . If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so.

The semantics of every element is defined in the HTML specifications. Some elements, such as span, are specifically defined as having no semantics. Not having semantics is also a valid choice: some text is only intended to be presentational, and is not intended to be interpreted in any significant way. Not all semantic elements are directly interpreted by assistive technology, strong and em are considered semantic, but don’t have any direct impact on how screen readers behave using default settings.

Joe Dolson and Andrea Fercia wrote a clear introduction and manual on the method in Let WordPress Speak, new in WordPress 4.2 . Example of a wp.a11y.speak() implementation . In this example a table with data is displayed. The user can select for example a category and the table with the data below will be updated dynamically. With wp.a11y.speak() we can announce that the table has been updated with new data. Note: for wp.a11y.speak() to work best, the .screen-reader-text CSS class should be added to your theme CSS. Also, wp.a11y.speak() is only available after DOM ready, so be sure not to call it earlier! .

Then run axe in the command line: . axe url -b c . The url can be any url, also a local one. You get a report of the accessibility issues for that url.

Navigate forward through all items on the page.

(A focus trap is when you can tab to an element but cannot tab past or outside of it when it receives focus.) | Verify that a visible focus state on all controls is present, and is a minimum of a 2px outline surrounding the element with a contrast that meets color contrast standards against the background color (see color contrast requirements). | Verify that the visual order of elements matches the order in which you reached the items. This generally means that the tab navigation travels in the reading direction of the content language, e.g. traveling from left to right and top to bottom in a LTR language. | Use shift + tab to reverse your tabbing path. Verify that the order of elements is the same forwards and backwards. | Verify that you can operate all controls. It is not required to test every individual link. Buttons should be operable using either the spacebar or the enter/return keys; links should only be activated using enter/return. | If a control opens a content panel, e.g. a dropdown menu, modal, or dialog, ensure that pressing tab again remains in the newly opened panel. | If focus is inside a modal or dialog that covers other content, verify that you cannot exit the modal using the tab key. | If focus is inside a modal or dialog that covers other content, verify that you can exit the modal either using a button to close the modal or by pressing the esc key. | Verify that no item is fully obscured when it receives focus. For example, if a menu or modal is opened, you should not be able to tab to an item behind the menu while it is opened. | Verify that intentionally hidden items (such as menu items in a collapsed navigation or links in a closed accordion) do not receive focus. | Adjust the website viewport or enable the browser console’s responsive view and repeat these tests in the mobile view. | . Keyboard navigation must be supported in all responsive views. While the native interaction on mobile devices is touch, the use of a keyboard to navigate mobile devices is an important tool for many users.

A search form could realistically have the search role, a visible label with the text Search, a placeholder with the text Search terms, a button with the text Search and a magnifying glass icon to indicate search. A search form must have some visible indicator that it is search, but does not need to incorporate every possible type of labeling. Including a magnifying glass icon only is considered an acceptable visual label for a search field. ",

It also makes your text easier to scan visually, so that sighted users can more quickly find the information they’re looking for. Descriptive, meaningful link text in the Apple VoiceOver link list. Make links texts descriptive . Avoid meaningless link text like: click here, download, info, more, here, this.

Emoji are independently accessible; they do have text alternatives. However, a large number of emoji can make the text effectively impossible to comprehend. Avoid writing links in all caps . Sequences of all capital letters are harder to read for people with dyslexia, screen readers may interpret short capitalized words as abbreviations, and read the words out character by character. This is also true if text is capitalized using CSS. Avoid using complete URLs as link text . Some URLs are highly readable, such as “wordpress.org”. Others are almost impossible to parse as language.

There are six standard landmark roles available in HTML. | role=\"banner\", the header element when nested in the context of the body element. | role=\"main\", the main element. | role=\"complementary\", the aside element. | role=\"contentinfo\", the footer element when nested in the context of the body element. | role=\"search\", a search form. | role=\"navigation\", the nav element. | . Most of these roles can be represented directly by their dedicated element; the search role must be assigned to the form element. Screen reader users are able to generate a list of landmarks on the page and navigate between them. The banner, main, and contentinfo landmarks should appear only once on a page. Other landmarks may appear multiple times, but each appearance should be accessibly named in a way that allows a screen reader user to identify it uniquely and usefully. There are additional optional landmark regions, such as the region role, which is a generic region that is only exposed if it has an accessible name. ",

You can help users avoid these problems by making all of your animations support the prefers-reduced-motion flag. prefers-reduced-motion is a system preference that allows the user to indicate that they would prefer not to see animations. But this only works if the code properly supports it! . You can check for this system preference using the CSS media feature: . @media (prefers-reduced-motion) { .animation { /* adjust your animations if reduced motion is requested. */ } } . Reduced motion doesn’t have to mean no animation at all, but it should be very minimal – no more than is absolutely necessary. When in doubt, eliminate the animation entirely. You can check for the media query in JavaScript by checking the value of the media query: . const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia(\"(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)\"); . ",

This information is filled in during the test setup process and is described in greater detail in setup documentation. Status explanation section . A reference cell explains the meaning of each status used throughout the report: . | Pass: All relevant aspects of the theme fully meet the requirements. | Fail: At least one aspect of the theme does not meet the requirement. | Not Applicable: This requirement does not apply to the page. | Not Evaluated/Test Incomplete: This requirement has not yet been tested. Completed reports should not have this status. | . If a requirement fails, testers are expected to add explanatory notes describing what fails and why. Requirements summary table .

Results entered here automatically populate the Summary tab and form the basis of the final review outcome. This tab is designed to support systematic, page-by-page testing across required templates while keeping results consistent, repeatable, and auditable. The Full Review tab enables testers to: . | Evaluate each Accessibility Ready requirement in detail. | Record pass/fail outcomes using standardized statuses and all required page templates. | Add concise notes explaining failures or relevant findings. | Identify patterns of failure that may justify stopping testing early. | . All accessibility-ready approval decisions should be based on evidence recorded in this tab. Table structure . The Full Review tab consists of a series of tables for each accessibility-ready requirement. Columns (pages and templates) . Column A in the sheet lists the tests for each accessibility-ready requirement. Each requirement is broken into specific, testable assertions (a “check”) that will result in a clear “pass” or “fail” result. The checks in each group are identical to the numbered steps in accessibility-ready requirement testing documentation. There are eight (8) additional columns, each of which represents a required page or template that must be tested: . | Front Page | Blog Page - /blog/ | Post with Comments - /template-comments/ | Category Archive - /category/block/ | Page Markup and Formatting - /accessibility-ready-test-pages/page-markup-and-formatting/ | Block Patterns - /accessibility-ready-test-pages/block-patterns/ | Search Results Page - /?s=block | 404 Page | . The slugs/page paths for these templates are provided in row 1 to make it easier to find these pages for testing. These slugs/paths map to content in the testing sites. Rows (results) . Each cell contains a dropdown with the following status options: . | Pass – The check passes on that page with no exceptions. | Fail – At least one instance fails on that page. | Not Applicable – The check does not apply to that page or template. | Not Evaluated – Testing has not yet been performed. | . A single failure on a page is sufficient to mark a check as Fail. Notes rows . Each requirement group includes a Notes row spanning all columns. Use Notes to: . | Briefly describe what failed and why. | Identify repeated or global issues. | Provide clarifying context when needed | . All notes across a row will be automatically combined into a single notes cell on the summary tab. For this reason, when adding notes, it is important to avoid duplicating identical notes and only document global issues once. Tester responsibilities for the full review tab . When entering information in the full review tab, testers should: . | Apply statuses consistently and accurately. | Provide concise but detailed notes with enough information for theme developer to understand what elements they need to fix to pass and failed checks. It can be helpful to use IDs or classes when describing problematic elements to they are easy for the developer to located. | Ensuring the recorded results are sufficient to support the review outcome. | .

    "content": "To accessibility-ready test a theme, you will first need to set up a testing environment. It is important to note that browser extensions for accessibility testing do not current work in WordPress Playground. As a result, you can’t use Playground for accessibility-ready reviews. Outside of Playground, reviews can be done in any WordPress environment you prefer. For convenience, we have a template site available for quick spin-up via InstaWP. Why use our InstaWP testing site . You may be wondering why we recommend using our InstaWP template for testing rather than loading the theme up on any other WordPress site. Here’s why: . Our InstaWP template has demo content including pages, posts, media, and navigation menus already configured so you can get started testing faster. We have also gone through the standard WordPress theme unit test data and remediated accessibility issues to avoid false positives. Additionally, specific pages and URLs from this site are referenced in the report template. For this reason, we recommend starting with an InstaWP testing site. If you prefer to test elsewhere, you can export the InstaWP content and import it into a different site using the WordPress Importer plugin. How to create your site . Notice: We are aware of some missing focus indicators and other accessibility issues with InstaWP’s launcher. These issues will be reported to them for remediation. If you are unable to create a test site due to accessibility issues, tag Amber Hinds and Joe Dolson (@alh0319 @joedolson) in #accessibility in Make WordPress Slack, and one of them will create a site for you. Here’s how to create a testing site from our template: . | Go to the WordPress Accessibility-ready Test Sites launcher on InstaWP. | Click the “launch demo” button. | Enter your email address in the email field. | Check the box acknowledging the privacy notice. | Click the “proceed” button. | . The website should be created in a matter of minutes and you will be automatically logged into the site. An email will be sent to you with the web address and admin credentials for logging into the website should you need to revisit the site later. Note: These sites expire after seven (7) days. You can extend them for three (3) additional days if needed. If you need a testing site to be available longer than 10 days, you’ll need to migrate it to your own hosting or local development environment. Install, activate, and configure the theme . After creating the site, you need to install and setup the theme for testing. Here are the steps to make sure you’re ready to test: . Installing and activating the theme . | Determine if you’re testing a new theme or existing theme. (See Identifying themes that need to be tested) | Install the theme in the testing site following these instructions: . | If the theme is a new theme or an existing theme with an unreleased new version: . | Go to the Trac ticket for the theme. | Download the latest zip file for the theme from the Trac ticket. There will be a zip file linked in the ticket, but check all comments to make sure a newer zip file has not been provided. | In WP-admin, go to Appearance &gt; Themes. | Click the “Add theme” link (visually styled as a button). | Click the “Upload Theme” button. | Upload your theme and click the “Install Now” button. | . | If the theme is already approved: . | In WP-admin, go to Appearance &gt; Themes. | Click the “Add theme” link (visually styled as a button). | Search for the theme by name. | Once you have found the theme, click the “Install” link (visually styled as a button) on the theme tile. | . | . | After installing the theme, click the “Activate” link (visually styled as a button) to activate it. | . Configuring the theme . Once the theme is active, you need to configure the theme content for testing. The following steps assume you’re starting with our InstaWP template content, in which case the setup work should be minimal. After activating the theme, do the following: . | If prompted to install “required” plugins, install and activate those plugins. | If prompted to import demo content, import the content. Important: Add demo content to the existing content rather than overwriting it. | Set up the menus: . | Set the primary menu in the header to the menu named “Primary”. | If a “mobile” menu exists, also assign the Primary menu to this menu area. | If a footer or other menu area exists, assign the “Social menu” or “All Pages Flat” menu to these areas. | . | Set up the Block Patterns page: . | Go to the Block Patterns page (/accessibility-ready-test-pages/block-patterns/). | Edit the Block Patterns page. | In the editing screen, click the Block inserter (+) in the top-left corner. | Click the Patterns tab. | Insert all available patterns into the page. Do not change any content or settings for the patterns. | Save the page. | . | Configure any other available settings. | If the theme supports the Customizer, open the Customizer and check for theme settings that need to be configured. | Check for a theme settings page and enable settings there as needed. | . | . Examples of other settings you may need to enable in the theme Customizer or settings pages include: . | Show search in header. | Enable comments. | Add related posts below content on post single. | Adding URLs to fields for social media profiles. | . Note: Each theme is different so the exact configuration process will vary by theme. Use these steps to guide you, however you may need to do something different if prompted by the theme. Ultimately the goal is to configure the theme in a way that is representative of how a typical website owner might configure it and to cover as many of the possible settings as is reasonably possible.

    "content": "There is no single “correct” way to move through Accessibility Ready testing. Testers generally fall into one of two workflows: testing an entire page at once, or testing a single check across all required pages first. Understanding the pros and cons of each approach can help you choose the method that best matches your experience level, focus style, and available time. Testing a whole page at once . In this approach, you load one page (for example, the front page) and test all applicable accessibility requirements before moving on to the next page. This approach is recommended if you prefer linear, page-based workflows. It mirrors the typical accessibility auditing process and is helpful if you expect to identify many failures (perhaps because you saw some while configuring the theme), and want the fastest understanding of status to report back to the theme developer. On the other hand, this approach may make testing and reporting slower because it requires more switching between tools and techniques than if you test a single check across all pages. Testing a single check across all pages first . In this approach, you choose one requirement (such as skip links or landmarks) and test it across every required page before moving on to the next requirement. This approach reduces context and tool switching. It may make identifying global issues and repeated patterns easier and can speed up reporting if you identify a global issue and drag the statuses across columns in the Google Sheet. The downside to this approach is that you may have fewer unique issues to note for the theme developer if you stop testing early based on a large numbers of failures. Choosing the right approach for you . Many experienced testers use a hybrid approach, starting with single-check testing to identify major blockers, then switching to page-based testing for more detailed reviews. If you are: . | New to Accessibility Ready testing: testing one check at a time across all pages may feel less overwhelming and help you gain confidence in testing. | Seeing early, obvious failures: testing multiple checks on a single page (like the home page) gives you a better understanding of what needs to be fixed when you report back to the theme developer. | . Whichever approach you choose, consistency in your process matters more than the order in which you test. One you get started you’ll build a rhythm and each accessibility ready review will get easier as you go. ",
