    "content": "Theme of this website is based on the Just The Docs Jekyll theme. Just the Docs is distributed by an MIT license. Copyright (c) 2016 Patrick Marsceill. In this initial release the theme is renamed into WP A11y Docs. The URL for the GitHib pages is wpaccessibility.org. File organisation . This will be a one design theme only, so all the changes will be done directly in the files itself. This simplifies the code and makes the theme better maintainable. For this the following changes were made: . | Removed custom files and their references. | Removed redundant include files. | Removed the nav-footer: took up too much space and added a second &lt;footer&gt;. | Added option for posts and post pagination. | Refactored the breadcrumbs for the posts. | Removed Just the Docs info pages and create placeholder text to match the actual site structure. | Set Ruby to 3.3.6. | Added option to add a canonical URL. | . SCSS . | Refactoring directory structure. | Removed the dark theme for now, that will be restored when the theme is finished and stable. | Replaced @import for @use, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced darken by color.scale and color.adjust, for compatibility with Dart Sass 3.0.0. | Replaced deprecated global built-in functions by Sass values (sass:map, sass:color, sass:list etc.). | . CSS color contrast issue . | Placeholder: fixt color contrast and opacity. | Fixed color contrast issues for text and non-text meaningful elements. | . Search at the top of the page . | Refactored the HTML of the form to make the HTML valid. | Added screen reader feedback to announce number of search results. | . _config.yml . | Removed Google Analytics Tracking settings. | Removed most variable because this is a static site. | Changed names and colours of the callouts to match those used in WordPress documentation style guide | . Accessibility improvements . | Moved the button to expand the submenus to after the submenu link, so the tab order is meaningful. | Changed aria-pressed by aria-expanded, see also issue Change aria-pressed into aria-expanded for buttons connected to expandable content. | Added aria-current=\"page\" to links to the current page. | Removed anchor links before headings. The link was inside the heading, resulting in announcing the heading text twice. Maybe we find an accessible way later on. | Copy code button is now always visible (not only on hover) and has a larger clickable area. The copy action has now also screenreader feedback. | The code blocks now have a tabindex=”0”. | . ",

An accessibility statement is not an audit report or an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR). Instead, it’s a shorter document or more designed page that provides transparency, helps set expectations, and indicates a path for support. If you have an audit report or ACR for your product, that can be linked to from your accessibility statement page. ",

This section provides a short summary of your approach to accessibility during theme development, goals, or accessibility commitments. Examples: . “This theme was designed and developed with accessibility best practices in mind, following WCAG 2.2 guidelines.” . “We are committed to making our plugins usable by as many people as possible, including those using assistive technologies.” . Quick Information . The Quick Information section provides a high-level overview of the theme’s or plugin’s accessibility test status and conformance level. Some content in this section is optional or may be omitted if it does not apply. | Accessibility audit completed: Yes or No. Answer yes if the theme or plugin has been audited for accessibility conformance with an officially recognized standard such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), EN 301 549, etc. The testing may have been completed by you or an external organization or individual. | Most recent audit date: (OPTIONAL) provide the date when most recent audit was completed. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Tested to standard and conformance level: (OPTIONAL) if an audit has been completed, list the standard it was tested against here and whether it supports, partially supports, or does not support the standard. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Audited by: (OPTIONAL) Provide a comma-separated list of wordpress.org userid’s or markdown-formatted links with Company Names and URLs for the people or organization that performed the most recent audit. This can help to provide trustworthiness or third-party verification to the audit. Omit if the theme or plugin has never been audited. | Accessibility Conformance Report: (OPTIONAL) URL to an Accessibility Conformance Report for the theme or plugin. Omit if an ACR is not available. Learn more about ACRs | . Testing Tools and Methodology . This section details how accessibility was tested and integrated into your development workflow. Be as detailed as possible to help website owners understand how the theme was tested as it was built, and if there is ongoing testing for updates. List tools and techniques used, and if the theme was tested by a third-party accessibility specialist. If users with disabilities or everyday users of assistive technology have participated in the testing process also include that information. Example: . “Accessibility was a core part of the development workflow for this theme from the initial design phase through final release. We followed WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines to ensure the theme is usable by people with a wide range of abilities and assistive technologies. During development, we used a combination of automated and manual testing methods: . | Automated Tools: . | Accessibility Checker WordPress plugin | axe DevTools browser extension | WAVE browser extension | ESLint with accessibility-focused rules for JSX and ARIA usage | . | Manual Testing Techniques: . | Keyboard-only navigation testing to ensure all interactive elements are focusable and operable | Screen reader testing with NVDA (Windows) and VoiceOver (macOS) to verify meaningful announcements, focus order, and labeling | Manual color contrast checks using the WebAIM Contrast Checker | Testing responsive behaviors to ensure accessibility is preserved on mobile and tablet devices | . All components and templates were tested for accessibility as they were developed. Additionally, we performed a full accessibility audit prior to release. The audit was conducted internally and verified by an external accessibility expert, John Doe, and we conducted user testing sessions with three blind screen reader users. We maintain a version-controlled accessibility checklist, and all theme updates go through regression testing to ensure accessibility is preserved. Any reported issues from users are logged and reviewed as part of our regular release process. This proactive and ongoing approach helps ensure the theme remains compliant and usable for all site visitors.” . | . Screen Reader Text Class . This section names the CSS class used in your theme or plugin to visually hide content but make it available to screen readers. Including the class here makes it easier for website owners to find and use the class. You may use any naming convention for your class, but must visually hide content with the required CSS for a screen reader text class. Example: .screen-reader-text . Accessibility Features . A list or description of accessibility enhancements built into the theme or plugin above and beyond theme accessibility-ready requirements. This section can be omitted if no features exist. Example: . “In addition to meeting accessibility-ready requirements, the theme provides stylesheets for light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode. These styles will be enabled automatically based on operating system color mode preferences, but in the theme settings, there is an option to turn on a front-end toggle allowing users to switch between color modes.” . Accessibility Help Contact . This section tells users how to get help if they experience accessibility issues with your theme or plugin. Examples: . “If you need accessibility help, email us at support@example.com.” . “Accessibility support information: https://example.com/support” . Where to Report Issues . This section provides a designated channel for users to report accessibility bugs or concerns. Examples: . https://wordpress.org/support/theme/theme-slug-here/ . “Please report accessibility issues on our GitHub repository, https://github.com/URL.” . ",

    "content": "The first rule of ARIA is, don’t use ARIA if there is a native HTML element for the job. But it’s valid to use aria-label or aria-labelledby to give an accessible name for a form control. If you have to, here are the basics: . Search . &lt;input type=\"search\" name=\"s\" aria-label=\"Search\"&gt; &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt; .

Visual text or equivalent, like a search icon, should always be visible, so sighted users don’t have to guess what they need to fill out. If you must hide a label or control from vision, use the CSS class .screen-reader-text or equivalent. Don’t use the CSS display: none, visibility: hidden or the HTML attribute hidden on a label, as that also removes the element, and its accessible name, from the accessibility tree. &lt;!-- this in incorrect code, the visual text Go is not describing what you need to fill out --&gt; &lt;label for=\"search-text\" class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;Search this website&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"s\" id=\"search-text\"&gt; &lt;button&gt;Go&lt;/button&gt; . &lt;!-- this in incorrect code, label is removed from the accessibility tree, the input field has no accessible name --&gt; &lt;label for=\"search-text\" hidden&gt;Search this website&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"s\" id=\"search-text\"&gt; &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt; .

A dialog is a window that separates content from the main content of a page. It can ask questions or require user input.

There are two main practices for achieving an accessible modal dialog: . | The use of appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties markup for dialog helps assistive technology identify the content as grouped and separated from the rest of the page. | Providing keyboard interaction and restricting focus within the modal helps keyboard users to navigate the content inside the dialog, and only navigate back to the main content when they’re ready. | .

A screen reader user can call a list of links to quickly navigate a site. Then duplicate and meaningless links are annoying and time-consuming. Duplicate links . How many links per block will go to the same location? Is the post title, the thumbnail and the read more all linked to the same destination? That will cause a great deal of link clutter on your page. If you have, for example, 3 links to the same destination, consider removing 2 from the link list by adding the attribute aria-hidden=\"true\". Then the link is removed from the screen readers link list. But adding aria-hidden=\"true\" alone might be confusing because you can tab into it, but it doesn’t announce anything for the screen reader users. So: take the link also out of the tab order by using tabindex=\"-1\": . &lt;a href=\"your-url\" aria-hidden=\"true\" tabindex=\"-1\"&gt; link text &lt;/a&gt; . Meaningless link text . Link text like “Read more…” or “Continue reading…” are meaningless, especially in a link list for screen reader users. Read more about what? It’s best to give context to links. Include the post title for your “read more” links so screen readers understand what’s being linked to, and optionally hide this by using the CSS class .screen-reader-text. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt; Your post title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Notice the blank space inside the .screen-reader-text? This separates teh words so the text is read out as “continue reading your” instead of “continue readingyour”. The alt text of the thumbnail . If the thumbnail is placed inside a link, the alt attribute serves as the link text. So it’s important that the alt text is not empty and contains the post title of the post it’s linking to. For example: . &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . Block level links . Wrapping a block level element, for example a heading and an image, inside a link is not helpful for screen readers. The whole content is read and there is no indication if an element inside the block is a heading or an image. Therefore, do not wrap the block level element in a link but place the link inside the child elements of the block. For example: . &lt;div class=\"your-card\"&gt; &lt;h3&gt; &lt;a href=\"your-url\"&gt;Your post title&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img src=\"img-url\" alt=\"Your post title\"&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . ",

But the link will show up in the headings list too this way, so that’s probably not a bad thing. As we are all used to the heading being a link, it has become a WordPress convention. Removing the “continue reading” link could be an option to cleanup the link clutter. The “continue reading” link is hidden for screen readers, but it has screen reader text. This is useful because, if a user has her own stylesheet, or watches the sites without stylesheet, the link text is still understandable.

The H1 (heading 1) is reserved for the post or page title. For most themes that is the title you give a page or post. Use heading 2, 3 and 4 to divide your content into meaningful sections, like the index of a book. Choose heading levels by meaning, not by visible size. This way search engines and screen readers (software used by your blind visitors) understand the structure and meaning of the content better. Headings are the index of your content. Content with a good heading structure ranks better with the search engines. Use it to divide content into scannable blocks; both Google and your visitor will like it. If you don’t like the sizes of the headings in your content, you should adjust the design of the heading rather than selecting a different heading. This helps with accessibility as well as with content adaptability. Selecting a heading based on size might make a change of theme more difficult. ",

Strong semantic structure, like what is provided by fieldset and legend is very helpful in understanding complex forms.

Instructions can range anywhere from an aria-describedby description associated with a single input, to a modal dialog that gives additional context or provides a worksheet to help the user calculate a value. Importantly, the line between understandable and…not can be very blurry; and you should always be looking at your form with an empathetic eye. Your knowledge of the form is likely much greater than your user’s. Validate user input . If it is possible to know whether a value is acceptable before the form is submitted, you should provide accessible validation as soon as possible. That validation should do more than simply notifying the user there is a problem with the field; it should also tell them how to fix it, if you’re able to provide that information.

You may think that you’re not including any images in your project. Possibly this is true; but are you using dashicons or other icon fonts? Are you using SVG graphics? . For accessibility, “images” doesn’t only refer to the img element. It means any non-text graphical elements on the page. This is particularly crucial if you’re using images to represent controls – a hamburger menu icon, an arrow, or a plus or minus icon. These images are used to represent information. All of these images require accessibility considerations. The W3C offers a useful decision tree to help you decide what kind of text you need for an image. If your image is conveying information or activating a control, it’s going to need some form of accessible name. Making an image accessible doesn’t necessarily mean ensuring that it is named, however. If an image is the sole presentation of data, then it needs to be named. If it is supplemental, and that same information is presented in text, then it should be hidden from screen readers. | Accessible SVGS from CSS Tricks | Font Icon accessibility from Font Awesome | .

    "content": "Forms, buttons, toggles, tabs – these are all elements commonly used both in the admin of your plugin and in public-facing interfaces. They’re also some of the most critical pieces for achieving a basic level of accessibility. At minimum, you should be considering: . Fields should be labeled . Every form input needs to have an associated &lt;label&gt; element. Those labels should be an accurate representation of the information required for that form. The label should be associated with the field using a for/id relationship: . &lt;label for=\"my_field\"&gt;Share your story&lt;/label&gt; &lt;textarea id=\"my_field\" name=\"my_story\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt; . Avoid hiding your labels visually. If you do need to hide a label, use a standard .screen-reader-text class to do so. Learn more about visually hidden text. Form groups need group names . If you’re providing a group of checkboxes or radio buttons, the label for the input isn’t usually enough information: it tells you the value you’re selecting, but not the question you’re trying to answer. Checkboxes and radio buttons should be grouped inside a &lt;fieldset&gt; with a &lt;legend&gt;. &lt;fieldset&gt; &lt;legend&gt;Why do you love WordPress plugins?&lt;/legend&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio1\" value=\"money\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio1\"&gt;Money&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio2\" value=\"fame\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio2\"&gt;Fame&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=\"radio\" id=\"radio3\" value=\"respect\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"radio3\"&gt;Respect&lt;/label&gt; &lt;/fieldset&gt; . Buttons should be &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; elements . Attaching JavaScript to &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt; elements can work great for mouse users, but leaves a ton of gaps for anybody using a screen reader or keyboard to use your site. Using standard form elements helps ensure that forms and toggles work for everybody. You can use an anchor element for button-like behavior, but this creates accessibility problems, such as preventing the user from cancelling the action. Announce dynamic changes audibly . When an AJAX action runs, announce it audibly or move focus to an appropriate new location on the page. WordPress contains a useful method called wp.a11y.speak() that you can use to announce results audibly. This gives screen reader users important feedback that something is happening, and what they can do next. If you’d show a result visually, you should also announce it audibly. Learn more about wp.a11y.speak(). Moving focus to a new location on the page will also generate new information for screen readers. This is appropriate when the action taken changes the user’s view, and they need to be informed of the change. Make it easy to identify and correct errors . When users input data into a form, provide them with feedback when a submission is made and notify them when they have entered something incorrectly. The error message should clearly describe the error and provide them with suggestions for correcting the error. Errors must be indicated by more than just a change of color. You can use icons and error lists to present this visually but make sure you audibly announce it. Use Color Appropriately . Good color contrast is important to make sure that users with a variety of visual impairments can use your interface. The most common problem cited is color blindness, but presbyopia (age-related vision impairments) are even more common, and most specifically impacted by low contrast. As eyes age, their ability to perceive low contrast differences decreases. The WCAG 2.1 guidelines measure contrast using a ratio comparing the relative luminosity of the colors. The guidelines stipulate a minimum contrast of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3.0:1 for large text using this ratio. You can test your colors using many tools: . | Joe Dolson’s Color Contrast Tool | WebAIM’s ContrastChecker | Lea Verou’s Contrast Ratio | . Good color contrast doesn’t mean extremely high contrast; the guidelines set a minimum baseline, and any contrast that meets that baseline is acceptable. ",

If the icon is ornamental, the font icon should still have the aria-hidden attribute, but the screen reader text should be omitted. &lt;a href=\"this.html\"&gt; &lt;span class=\"dashicons dashicon-thumbs-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"screen-reader-text\"&gt;Something&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt; . For SVG, the SVG should be inline, so that accessible information isn’t hidden from assistive technology. SVG elements should contain a &lt;title&gt; element with the accessible name of the image. For cross-technology support, the title element should be associated with the svg element via aria-labelledby. For maximum compatibility, all SVG elements used to represent an image should carry the role attribute with a value of img. If the SVG element is ornamental, then the title element should be omitted and no aria-labelledby attribute should be present. The SVG element should also carry the aria-hidden attribute. | More information on SVG Accessibility by Léonie Watson | . Labeling . Existing code uses a mixture of explicitly and implicitly labeled fields, but all new code must use an explicitly associated element (using for/id attributes and not wrapping the form control). Labels are not required to be visible, but must use the .screen-reader-text class when hidden. Placeholders are fine, but are not a substitute for labels. For all labels, clicking on the field label should cause the associated field to receive focus or, for checkboxes and radio selectors, select that choice. Don’t introduce new title attributes to convey information. Use aria-label when you need to provide an alternate label and .screen-reader-text if you’re appending additional data. When using aria-label, be sure that the aria-label value contains any visible text on the control. The visible text should be the first part of the aria-label text. E.g. &lt;button type=\"button\" aria-label=\"Delete this post\"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt; . When creating forms, use &lt;fieldset&gt; and &lt;legend&gt; to group logically related form elements inside complex forms or to group radio buttons and checkboxes under a heading. ",

    "content": "The big difference between PHP and JavaScript code standard checks and accessibility checks is that the accessibility checks need to be performed on the generated DOM, not on the code base. You need to run checks on a working WordPress site. This can be done using automation that sets up your environment dynamically, but still requires a fully built and run installation. There are several command line tools for automated testing like aXe-cli and pa11y. Info: Automated accessibility testing doesn’t catch all the issues, rarely more than 30%. Testing in the browser and manual keyboard testing still needs to be part of your workflow. Setup for aXe-cli . Install axe-core for CLI first: . npm install axe-cli -g npm install chromedriver –g` . Then run axe in the command line: . axe url -b c . The url can be any url, also a local one. You get a report of the accessibility issues for that url. The -b stands for browser, c for chrome, as this browser gives the best results (better than the default PhantomJS). You will get the errors and warnings in your console. You can provide more (space separated) urls to the command like . axe url url2 url3 -b c . or call a file with urls like: . axe $( cat list-of-urls.txt ) -b c . Note: You can run axe-cli on more than one url in one command, but axe-cli is not build to run on a large amount of urls or on a complete site, axe-cli is not a crawler. Deque Labs recommends to use the axe-webdriverjs, a chainable aXe API for Selenium’s WebDriverJS for testing on a large amounts of urls. Setup for pa11y .

A WordPress theme generally only supports a handful of inputs: the search form and the comment form. However, the principles apply to any input created by the theme. Search forms are a unique case, because they are simple forms that frequently have many different labels. A search form could realistically have the search role, a visible label with the text Search, a placeholder with the text Search terms, a button with the text Search and a magnifying glass icon to indicate search. A search form must have some visible indicator that it is search, but does not need to incorporate every possible type of labeling. Including a magnifying glass icon only is considered an acceptable visual label for a search field. ",

This can be prevented by not checking “open link in a new target” on links, so they don’t trigger new windows or tabs to open. But what if you insist? .

Rule of thumb: a link text should describe the resource that it links to, so that when the text is read out of context the user will still know what to expect. A link is a promise, not a surprise. Link text should stand on its own. Some assistive software scans a page for links and presents them to the user as a simple list. In these situations, all the links will be read out of context. So it is important the text used in a link is descriptive and meaningful. It also makes your text easier to scan visually, so that sighted users can more quickly find the information they’re looking for. Descriptive, meaningful link text in the Apple VoiceOver link list. Make links texts descriptive . Avoid meaningless link text like: click here, download, info, more, here, this. With these types of links, users have to read the whole sentence to understand the purpose of the link. This makes your content less browsable, and harder to engage with. Screen reader users cannot navigate by links, because those links are not useful without additional context. Useless, non-descriptive link text in the Apple VoiceOver link list.

Emoji are independently accessible; they do have text alternatives. However, a large number of emoji can make the text effectively impossible to comprehend. Avoid writing links in all caps . Sequences of all capital letters are harder to read for people with dyslexia, screen readers may interpret short capitalized words as abbreviations, and read the words out character by character. This is also true if text is capitalized using CSS. Avoid using complete URLs as link text . Some URLs are highly readable, such as “wordpress.org”. Others are almost impossible to parse as language. In most cases, you should avoid using a URL as the visible link text. If you are explicitly referring to a web address, keep it short: wordpress.org instead of https://www.wordpress.org.

This tab is designed to support systematic, page-by-page testing across required templates while keeping results consistent, repeatable, and auditable. The Full Review tab enables testers to: . | Evaluate each Accessibility Ready requirement in detail. | Record pass/fail outcomes using standardized statuses and all required page templates. | Add concise notes explaining failures or relevant findings. | Identify patterns of failure that may justify stopping testing early. | . All accessibility-ready approval decisions should be based on evidence recorded in this tab. Table structure . The Full Review tab consists of a series of tables for each accessibility-ready requirement. Columns (pages and templates) . Column A in the sheet lists the tests for each accessibility-ready requirement. Each requirement is broken into specific, testable assertions (a “check”) that will result in a clear “pass” or “fail” result. The checks in each group are identical to the numbered steps in accessibility-ready requirement testing documentation. There are eight (8) additional columns, each of which represents a required page or template that must be tested: . | Front Page | Blog Page - /blog/ | Post with Comments - /template-comments/ | Category Archive - /category/block/ | Page Markup and Formatting - /accessibility-ready-test-pages/page-markup-and-formatting/ | Block Patterns - /accessibility-ready-test-pages/block-patterns/ | Search Results Page - /?s=block | 404 Page | . The slugs/page paths for these templates are provided in row 1 to make it easier to find these pages for testing. These slugs/paths map to content in the testing sites. Rows (results) . Each cell contains a dropdown with the following status options: . | Pass – The check passes on that page with no exceptions. | Fail – At least one instance fails on that page. | Not Applicable – The check does not apply to that page or template. | Not Evaluated – Testing has not yet been performed. | . A single failure on a page is sufficient to mark a check as Fail. Notes rows . Each requirement group includes a Notes row spanning all columns. Use Notes to: . | Briefly describe what failed and why. | Identify repeated or global issues. | Provide clarifying context when needed | . All notes across a row will be automatically combined into a single notes cell on the summary tab. For this reason, when adding notes, it is important to avoid duplicating identical notes and only document global issues once. Tester responsibilities for the full review tab . When entering information in the full review tab, testers should: . | Apply statuses consistently and accurately. | Provide concise but detailed notes with enough information for theme developer to understand what elements they need to fix to pass and failed checks. It can be helpful to use IDs or classes when describing problematic elements to they are easy for the developer to located. | Ensuring the recorded results are sufficient to support the review outcome. | .

If you decide to use required, also use novalidate on the form element to prevent the browser’s form validation from kicking in and enable you to handle validation server-side. &lt;form action=\"some-url\" novalidate&gt; . Note: The use of aria-invalid will be addressed later in the section Feedback on form errors. ",

    "content": "To accessibility-ready test a theme, you will first need to set up a testing environment. It is important to note that browser extensions for accessibility testing do not current work in WordPress Playground. As a result, you can’t use Playground for accessibility-ready reviews. Outside of Playground, reviews can be done in any WordPress environment you prefer. For convenience, we have a template site available for quick spin-up via InstaWP. Why use our InstaWP testing site . You may be wondering why we recommend using our InstaWP template for testing rather than loading the theme up on any other WordPress site. Here’s why: . Our InstaWP template has demo content including pages, posts, media, and navigation menus already configured so you can get started testing faster. We have also gone through the standard WordPress theme unit test data and remediated accessibility issues to avoid false positives. Additionally, specific pages and URLs from this site are referenced in the report template. For this reason, we recommend starting with an InstaWP testing site. If you prefer to test elsewhere, you can export the InstaWP content and import it into a different site using the WordPress Importer plugin. How to create your site . Notice: We are aware of some missing focus indicators and other accessibility issues with InstaWP’s launcher. These issues will be reported to them for remediation. If you are unable to create a test site due to accessibility issues, tag Amber Hinds and Joe Dolson (@alh0319 @joedolson) in #accessibility in Make WordPress Slack, and one of them will create a site for you. Here’s how to create a testing site from our template: . | Go to the WordPress Accessibility-ready Test Sites launcher on InstaWP. | Click the “launch demo” button. | Enter your email address in the email field. | Check the box acknowledging the privacy notice. | Click the “proceed” button. | . The website should be created in a matter of minutes and you will be automatically logged into the site. An email will be sent to you with the web address and admin credentials for logging into the website should you need to revisit the site later. Note: These sites expire after seven (7) days. You can extend them for three (3) additional days if needed. If you need a testing site to be available longer than 10 days, you’ll need to migrate it to your own hosting or local development environment. Install, activate, and configure the theme . After creating the site, you need to install and setup the theme for testing. Here are the steps to make sure you’re ready to test: . Installing and activating the theme . | Determine if you’re testing a new theme or existing theme. (See Identifying themes that need to be tested) | Install the theme in the testing site following these instructions: . | If the theme is a new theme or an existing theme with an unreleased new version: . | Go to the Trac ticket for the theme. | Download the latest zip file for the theme from the Trac ticket. There will be a zip file linked in the ticket, but check all comments to make sure a newer zip file has not been provided. | In WP-admin, go to Appearance &gt; Themes. | Click the “Add theme” link (visually styled as a button). | Click the “Upload Theme” button. | Upload your theme and click the “Install Now” button. | . | If the theme is already approved: . | In WP-admin, go to Appearance &gt; Themes. | Click the “Add theme” link (visually styled as a button). | Search for the theme by name. | Once you have found the theme, click the “Install” link (visually styled as a button) on the theme tile. | . | . | After installing the theme, click the “Activate” link (visually styled as a button) to activate it. | . Configuring the theme . Once the theme is active, you need to configure the theme content for testing. The following steps assume you’re starting with our InstaWP template content, in which case the setup work should be minimal. After activating the theme, do the following: . | If prompted to install “required” plugins, install and activate those plugins. | If prompted to import demo content, import the content. Important: Add demo content to the existing content rather than overwriting it. | Set up the menus: . | Set the primary menu in the header to the menu named “Primary”. | If a “mobile” menu exists, also assign the Primary menu to this menu area. | If a footer or other menu area exists, assign the “Social menu” or “All Pages Flat” menu to these areas. | . | Set up the Block Patterns page: . | Go to the Block Patterns page (/accessibility-ready-test-pages/block-patterns/). | Edit the Block Patterns page. | In the editing screen, click the Block inserter (+) in the top-left corner. | Click the Patterns tab. | Insert all available patterns into the page. Do not change any content or settings for the patterns. | Save the page. | . | Configure any other available settings. | If the theme supports the Customizer, open the Customizer and check for theme settings that need to be configured. | Check for a theme settings page and enable settings there as needed. | . | . Examples of other settings you may need to enable in the theme Customizer or settings pages include: . | Show search in header. | Enable comments. | Add related posts below content on post single. | Adding URLs to fields for social media profiles. | . Note: Each theme is different so the exact configuration process will vary by theme. Use these steps to guide you, however you may need to do something different if prompted by the theme. Ultimately the goal is to configure the theme in a way that is representative of how a typical website owner might configure it and to cover as many of the possible settings as is reasonably possible.

    "content": "There is no single “correct” way to move through Accessibility Ready testing. Testers generally fall into one of two workflows: testing an entire page at once, or testing a single check across all required pages first. Understanding the pros and cons of each approach can help you choose the method that best matches your experience level, focus style, and available time. Testing a whole page at once . In this approach, you load one page (for example, the front page) and test all applicable accessibility requirements before moving on to the next page. This approach is recommended if you prefer linear, page-based workflows. It mirrors the typical accessibility auditing process and is helpful if you expect to identify many failures (perhaps because you saw some while configuring the theme), and want the fastest understanding of status to report back to the theme developer. On the other hand, this approach may make testing and reporting slower because it requires more switching between tools and techniques than if you test a single check across all pages. Testing a single check across all pages first . In this approach, you choose one requirement (such as skip links or landmarks) and test it across every required page before moving on to the next requirement. This approach reduces context and tool switching. It may make identifying global issues and repeated patterns easier and can speed up reporting if you identify a global issue and drag the statuses across columns in the Google Sheet. The downside to this approach is that you may have fewer unique issues to note for the theme developer if you stop testing early based on a large numbers of failures. Choosing the right approach for you . Many experienced testers use a hybrid approach, starting with single-check testing to identify major blockers, then switching to page-based testing for more detailed reviews. If you are: . | New to Accessibility Ready testing: testing one check at a time across all pages may feel less overwhelming and help you gain confidence in testing. | Seeing early, obvious failures: testing multiple checks on a single page (like the home page) gives you a better understanding of what needs to be fixed when you report back to the theme developer. | . Whichever approach you choose, consistency in your process matters more than the order in which you test. One you get started you’ll build a rhythm and each accessibility ready review will get easier as you go. ",
